# Data Analysis and Visualization Libraries
- ### Numpy
> NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. This tutorial explains the basics of NumPy such as its architecture and environment. It also discusses the various array functions, types of indexing, etc. An introduction to Matplotlib is also provided. All this is explained with the help of examples for better understanding.
- ### Matplotlib
> Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.
- ### Pandas
> Pandas is an open-source, BSD-licensed Python library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. Python with Pandas is used in a wide range of fields including academic and commercial domains including finance, economics, Statistics, analytics, etc.In this tutorial, we will learn the various features of Python Pandas and how to use them in practice.
